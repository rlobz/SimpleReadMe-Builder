# SimpleReadMe-Builder

This ReadMe Builder is a Node.js command-line application that dynamically creates a professional README.md file from user input. It simplifies the process of creating a README, allowing developers to spend more time on their projects. The application uses the Inquirer package to prompt users for information about their project and then generates a README file with sections including a title, description, table of contents, installation instructions, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions.
